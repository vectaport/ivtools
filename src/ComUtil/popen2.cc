//FUNCTION  DEFINITION:
 
/*  Pre:  The  shell  command  that  should  be  executed  is  passed  as  a  parameter.
 *            Values  of  0  for  p_fd_in  or  p_fd_out  indicates  shell  command  doesn't
 *            use  stdin  or  stdout  respectively,  so  they  should  be  closed.
 *  Post:  Makes  accessible  both  the  standard  input  and  output  of  the  shell  
 *              process  it  creates.
 *              Two  pipes  are  created:  one  provides  standard  input  for  the  shell  
 *              commmand,  and  the  other  for  passing  back  its  standard  output.
 *              The  pipe  file  descriptors  for  the  caller  to  use  are  pointed  to  by  
 *              p_fd_in  and  p_fd_out.
