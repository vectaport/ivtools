# ComTerp Architecture

## Overview

ComTerp is a command interpreter with an unusual hybrid evaluation model:
postfix token execution with per-command opt-in lazy evaluation. This
combination gives it the efficiency of a stack-based VM with the expressive
power of a lazy interpreter — without the overhead of either continuations
or tree-walking.

## Postfix Execution Model

ComTerp parses input into a flat array of postfix tokens (`_pfbuf`), then
converts them into a parallel array of `ComValue` objects (`_pfcomvals`).
This array is immutable for the lifetime of an expression and shared across
all command invocations during evaluation.

Execution proceeds left-to-right through `_pfcomvals`. Non-command values
are pushed onto the eval stack. When a command is encountered,
`eval_expr_internals()` fires the corresponding `ComFunc::execute()` method
with arguments already on the stack.

## The Argoffval Bookmark

The central mechanism that makes lazy evaluation possible is a single
pushed integer — the **argoffval**.

When `load_sub_expr()` encounters a `post_eval` command in `_pfcomvals`,
it pushes the command's current index (`_pfoff`) onto the eval stack as an
integer `ComValue` before pushing the command itself:

```cpp
if (func && func->post_eval()) {
    ComValue argoffval(_pfoff);
    push_stack(argoffval);
}
```

Inside the `post_eval` command's `execute()` method, `stack_top()` retrieves
this integer — a bookmark into `_pfcomvals` pointing just past the command.
`skip_arg_in_expr()` uses this bookmark to walk backward through `_pfcomvals`
and locate the start of each argument sub-expression.

This costs one integer push per lazy command invocation. No sub-expression
copying, no re-parsing, no continuation allocation.

## Eager vs Lazy Commands

**Eager commands** (`post_eval() == false`, the default):
- Arguments are evaluated before `execute()` fires
- Arguments arrive on the eval stack as fully evaluated `ComValue` objects
- `stack_arg(n)` retrieves the nth argument

**Lazy commands** (`post_eval() == true`):
- Arguments are NOT pre-evaluated
- The argoffval bookmark is pushed before the command
- `stack_arg_post_eval(n)` navigates `_pfcomvals` via the bookmark,
  calls `post_eval_expr()` to evaluate argument n on demand, returns result
- `stack_key_post_eval(id)` does the same for keyword arguments

This opt-in mechanism is what makes `if()`, `while()`, `for()`, `func()`,
and `assign()` work correctly — they receive unevaluated sub-expressions
and choose if, when, and how many times to evaluate each one.

## Post-Eval Depth (pedepth)

`_pfcomvals` entries inside a `post_eval` command's argument scope carry a
`pedepth > 0`. `load_sub_expr()` computes these depths by scanning backward
from each `post_eval` command using `skip_func()`. During normal evaluation,
tokens with `pedepth > 0` are skipped — they are only evaluated when a
`post_eval` command explicitly calls `post_eval_expr()`.

Nested `post_eval` commands increment the depth further, allowing arbitrary
nesting of lazy constructs.

Post-eval evaluation does not alter the execution model or execution
structure; it only changes when argument sub-expressions are evaluated
relative to a fixed execution substrate.

## ComValue and _flags

`ComValue` extends `AttributeValue` with command/keyword metadata:

- `_narg`, `_nkey` — argument and keyword counts for command tokens
- `_nids` — delimiter token type (used for bracket matching)
- `_pedepth` — post-eval nesting depth
- `_flags` — bitfield for per-instance boolean flags:
  - `COMVALUE_BQUOTE_FLAG (0x01)` — return symbol without lookup
  - `COMVALUE_LHS_ASSIGN_FLAG (0x02)` — set by AssignFunc on a global()
    command ComValue to indicate lhs assignment context

Since `_pfcomvals` is an immutable array of `ComValue` objects (one per
postfix token), flags set on a specific `ComValue` in the array persist
for the lifetime of the expression and are copied when that `ComValue` is
pushed onto the eval stack.

### nids() Values

`nids()` is copied from `postfix_token.nids` into `ComValue` and has
accumulated meaning over time:

| nids | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-1` | dot-rhs bare identifier — suppress `SymbolType` → `CommandType` promotion in `code_conversion()` (ivtools 2.2+) |
| `0` | default/unset — used by `empty` (trailing comma sentinel) |
| `1` | one argument list: `func(args)` — normal command |
| `2-17` | multiple argument lists: `func(list1)(list2)` — number of paren-delimited groups following the command token; used for ipl and the Wave instruction set, and available for any domain needing multi-list dispatch |
| `>= 18` | delimiter token type (`TOK_RPAREN`=18, `TOK_RBRACE`=22 etc.) for bracket-matching dispatch via `_delim_func` in `code_conversion()` |

The `-1` convention was introduced to allow `a.type` to do a key lookup
against an attrlist rather than dispatch the `type()` command. The
parser emits `nids=-1` for bare identifiers on the rhs of `.`; the
promotion guard in `code_conversion()` checks `sv->nids() != -1` before
converting `SymbolType` to `CommandType`.

The `2-17` range preserves the original intent of the field name —
"number of ids" meaning number of argument lists. The `>= 18` overload
and `-1` extension are the only departures from that original meaning.

## func() command for user written commands

The func() command:

    funcobj=func(body :echo) -- encapsulate a body of commands into an executable object

is a comterp primitive for creating new user-defined commands.  It is one of
the commands with arguments that are post or lazy evaluated.  In general the
post evaluation is used for conditonally executing blocks of code in an if(),
for(), while(), or switch(). But in the func() case it takes the yet-to-be
evaluated block which is its argument and returns it in on the stack in a
funcobj.

The funcobj is invoked later by giving the variable that holds it a list of
keyword arguments in parentheses:

    f=func(print("%v is of type %v\n" x type(x)))
    f(:x 1.e7)

and you will see:

    1e+07 is of type DoubleType

The keyword argument's value becomes the value of a local variable within the
the funcobj's scope.  All other variables outside the func body are available
read-only within the func body.  Any variable assigned to within the func body
becomes a local variable within the scope of the func body.

The func returns information by pushing a result on the stack, the value
that results from executing the body of the func.

Similar to most any command line processing, the keyword arguments
(and eventually the fixed-format arguments at the start of the
command) are not declared in the func() call or its body.  It is only the
subsequent attempt to retrieve known values associated with a symbol
that resolves whether it is keyword/value pair stored in the func()'s
AttributeList, or a local variable, or a global variable.

## func() improvements

Currently the narg() and arg() commands only work for the command line.
They can be extended to provide for fixed-format arguments for func() use.
Along with what would be nkey() and maybe even nids() commands as well. The
end result would be user-defined funcs that behaved exactly like built-in
primitives.  Right now at least one keyword argument is required to call
the funcobj.

A new local() command would allow a func body to escape and set a value
outside its scope.  global() could work the same way.  Have to consider
the func() within a func() (a factory script) when implementing local().
local() might allow access to all variables that aren't global.  A
companion command to local() and global() might only go up one level
when searching for variables (the func body that is calling the lower
level func body) but that seems complicated to use as a programmer.  If
an escape to a larger namespace is needed, having a two tier system of
global() and local() is enough, and otherwise variables created or update
within a func body are invisible unless returned.

Another thing to consider is if any declaration of expected arguments
is required or useful.  Right now there is no :help supported as a
special keyword parameter for all func()'s and there probably never
will be.  The model for help within comterp is using the help() func,
and :docstr could be added to the func command that inserts that help
string into the help system.

## Global Variable Lhs/Rhs Context

`global(sym)=val` requires `global()` to behave differently depending on
whether it is the lhs or rhs of an assignment:

- **lhs**: push a bquoted, global-flagged symbol for `AssignFunc` to write to
- **rhs**: look up and push the symbol's value from the global table

`AssignFunc::execute()` uses `skip_arg_in_expr()` via the argoffval bookmark
to locate the start of its arg 0 sub-expression in `_pfcomvals`. If that
start token is a `global` command, it sets `COMVALUE_LHS_ASSIGN_FLAG` on
that specific `ComValue`.

When `post_eval_expr()` later evaluates the lhs sub-expression and fires
`GlobalSymbolFunc::execute()`, that command can peek at its own `ComValue`
on the eval stack via `stack_top(nargs()+nkeys())` and check
`lhs_assign()`. Only the outermost `global()` explicitly flagged by
`AssignFunc` sees the flag — inner `global()` calls in rvalue position
within the same lhs expression are unaffected.

## Symbol and Global Tables

ComTerp maintains two variable tables per interpreter instance:

- `localtable()` — per-invocation local variables, scoped to the current
  `func()` body or top-level expression
- `globaltable()` — persistent across expressions, shared across all
  interpreter instances on the same `ComTerp`

`lookup_symval()` checks local first, then global. The `global_flag` on a
`ComValue` forces writes and reads to bypass local and go directly to
`globaltable()`.


## Symbol Registration Pattern

ComTerp uses a global string-interning table where every identifier, operator
name, and command name is stored exactly once and referred to by integer symid.
`symbol_add(str)` is idempotent — calling it twice with the same string returns
the same id both times. `symbol_pntr(id)` is the inverse.

The canonical pattern for a ComFunc implementor is a function-local static,
so the `symbol_add` call fires exactly once per process lifetime regardless
of how many times `execute()` is called:

```cpp
void ListFunc::execute() {
  ComValue listv(stack_arg_post_eval(0));
  static int strmlst_symid = symbol_add("strmlst"); // hidden debug keyword
  ComValue strmlstv(stack_key_post_eval(strmlst_symid));
  static int attr_symid = symbol_add("attr");
  ComValue attrv(stack_key_post_eval(attr_symid));
  static int size_symid = symbol_add("size");
  ComValue sizev(stack_key_post_eval(size_symid));
  reset_stack();
  ...
}
```

Every keyword a command accepts is registered this way. The symid is then
passed to `stack_key()` or `stack_key_post_eval()` to retrieve the keyword's
value from the stack. Symids registered via the static pattern live for the
process lifetime — `symbol_del()` is reference-counted but ComFunc code
almost never calls it.

## Delimiter Semantics

ComTerp treats `()`, `{}`, `[]`, and `<>` as equivalent nesting delimiters
at the parser level — the parser requires open/close pairs to match type, but
all four pairs have equal precedence and nesting behavior. By convention:

- `()` — grouping and attrlist literals: `(:a 1 :b 2)` constructs an
  `AttributeList`. An empty `()` constructs an empty `AttributeList`.
- `{}` — list literals: `{1 2 3}` constructs an `AttributeValueList`.
  An empty `{}` constructs an empty list, equivalent to `list()`.
- `[]` — reserved for flowtran flowgraph syntax
- `<>` — reserved for flowtran flowgraph syntax

The parser emits a `COMMAND` token for each closing delimiter. For non-empty
`{}`, the command resolves to the `+{}` (bracesplus) operator which builds
the list from its args. For empty `{}`, the parser emits a `COMMAND` with
`list_symid` and `narg 0`, producing an empty `AttributeValueList` directly.
Similarly, empty `()` emits `attrlist` with `narg 0`.

## Language as Protocol

The language-as-protocol property follows from this model: because
every type has a brief serialization that is valid ComTerp syntax,
values round-trip through `print()`/`run()` and through the TCP wire
protocol identically. There is no separate encoding layer. A terminal
session on stdin/stdout and a programmatic session over a socket are
the same thing.

Because the scanner and parser are runtime-configurable — operator
precedence, associativity, and delimiter meanings can all be changed
between parse passes from a script — ComTerp can be reconfigured to
interpret other wire protocols and domain-specific languages, not just
its own syntax. A domain-specific language is a small language tailored
to a particular problem domain: JSON, SQL, the DrawServ drawing command
protocol, or a custom image processing command set are all examples.
Point ComTerp at a different token shape, reconfigure the delimiters,
define the operator precedence, and it becomes the interpreter for that
language without any recompilation.

This reconfiguration can happen in two distinct modes:

**One-way reconfiguration.** Boot ComTerp into a new interpreter
permanently by running a setup script that reconfigures the scanner and
parser before any user input is processed. ComTerp becomes the runtime
for the target language — a flowgraph interpreter, a JSON reader, a
custom DSL — and stays there. The original ComTerp syntax is gone;
the new language is what the interpreter speaks.

**Block-scoped reconfiguration.** A `post_eval` command receives its
argument as an unevaluated postfix block, reconfigures the parser,
evaluates the block under the new interpretation, then restores the
previous configuration. The outer function is the context switch — the
block executes in a different language, and on return the caller's
language is back in effect. This is how a `json()` command could work:

```
json({
  "name": "foo",
  "values": [1, 2, 3]
})
```

`json()` reconfigures `[` and `]` as list delimiters before evaluating
its block, the block is parsed and executed as JSON, and the result is
returned as a ComTerp attrlist/list. The surrounding script never knew
anything changed.

## Runtime Operator Table Mutation

The operator table is not fixed at compile time. It is runtime-mutable
and readable via `optable()`. This means the language itself can be
reconfigured at boot time from a script — new operators, changed
precedence, domain-specific syntax — and the parser reads the current
table on each parse, so changes take effect immediately for subsequent
expressions without recompilation.

This is the same property that made the `nids()` mechanism sufficient
for the Wave instruction set and ipl: the token structure carries enough
information to reconstruct operator meaning without baking it into a
static grammar.

## Interaction Model and Command Serialization Boundary

ComTerp defines a system in which multiple interaction models coexist
independently while sharing a common semantic serialization format for
all meaningful state-changing operations. The GUI, ComTerp command
language, and network interfaces are parallel entry points into the
same execution engine rather than layered abstractions over one
another.

### Independent GUI Model

The graphical interface is a fully autonomous interaction system. It
maintains its own internal state for tools, selections, and user
interaction flow. It does not require knowledge of the ComTerp command
system to function, and it is not implemented as a thin layer over a
command interpreter.

The GUI is therefore not a visualization of the command system, nor
does it depend on ComTerp semantics for its internal operation.

### Command System as Semantic Representation

The ComTerp command system defines a structured, deterministic model
of operations on documents and data. Commands are executed within the
interpreter and produce state changes in the underlying model.

Critically, (most) every semantically meaningful operation available in the
GUI can be expressed as a ComTerp command sequence. This establishes a
lossless semantic encoding boundary:

* GUI operations → can be serialized into command streams
* Command streams → can be replayed to reproduce equivalent state transitions

### Shared Serialization Boundary

The key architectural invariant is not coupling, but equivalence of expressible operations:

> The GUI and ComTerp command system are independent interaction
  domains that share a common serialization format for all meaningful
  state-changing operations.

This implies:

* The GUI can operate without the command system
* The command system can operate without the GUI
* The command stream is sufficient to reconstruct system state transitions

### Replay, Persistence, and External Control

Because all semantically relevant operations can be expressed in the
command stream, that stream becomes a universal interface for:

* persistence
* replay
* debugging
* network transmission
* automation

Any external system capable of generating valid command sequences can
interact with ComTerp at the same semantic level as the GUI.

### Architectural Implication

This design yields a system where:

* Interaction is multi-modal (GUI, REPL, network)
* Semantics are centralized in the command model
* Representation is uniform across all interfaces
* No single interface is privileged as the source of truth

The result is not a GUI-driven system with scripting support, but a
system where multiple independent interfaces converge on a shared
executable representation of operations.

## Relationship to the Execution Model

This interaction model is tightly coupled to ComTerp’s execution architecture.

ComTerp’s postfix evaluation model, lazy argument evaluation system,
and deterministic command execution semantics ensure that command
streams are stable, replayable, and context-independent. Because
execution is defined entirely in terms of a linearized sequence of
`ComValue` operations over an immutable postfix buffer, the system
naturally supports serialization of all meaningful computation steps.

As a result, the command stream is not an external API layer; it is a
direct expression of the interpreter’s execution model. This is what
allows GUI actions, REPL input, and network messages to be treated as
equivalent sources of computation.

Both command histories and snapshot documents are first-class,
executable ComTerp representations of drawing state.
