June 12th 2000 ivtools-0.8.3

- remove the output for a ComValue of BlankType in the related ostream
operator.  This puts it back to the way it has long been.  The output
of "<blank>" was just a temporary debugging thing.

- add an "acknowledgebox" command (AcknowledgeBoxFunc) to command, to allow
a script to pop-up a dialog box and require the user to press ok.

- add a confirmbox command to comdraw that returns 1 for Yes, 0 for
No, and -1 if Cancelled.

- use a self-growing STL (Standard Template Library) vector<char> to
read comterp commands from a socket.  This replaces the year-old hack
of using a 1 megabyte input buffer (BUFSIZ*BUFSIZ), which was
problematic in certain run-time environments, causing an inexplicable
crash at the head of ComterpHandler::handle_input before any code of
the method was executed.

If this approach proves out, it should be migrated to all the other
large input buffers spread around ivtools (where-ever the size is
BUFSIZ*BUFSIZ), and would make for a significant reduction in the
runtime footprint of some programs.

- fix AttributeValue::geta(int classid) and add back a
ComValue::geta(int classid)

- fix the use of CLASS_SYMID macro in OverlaysComp class definition.
It was missing the "s" from the class name string.

- new comterp commands to "split" a string or symbol into a list of
characters, and to "join" a list of characters into a string or
symbol.

- add -DUnidrawCommon to the compiler command line in the
Unidraw-common library, and make judicious use of "#ifndef
UnidrawCommon" in Unidraw/component.c and Unidraw/compview.c, so they
only pull in stuff out of libUnidraw-common.

- print "nil" instead of "Unknown type" when a ComValue is of
UnknownType, since that is how UnknownType is used throughout comterp,
as the nil value which means no value.

- bug fixed in AttributeListEditor where a fixed buffer of length 1024
was overflowed.  Replaced with a vector <char> instead.

- change comterp eval command to return a single value if it has only one argument.

- change the Dialog class so that a box put up with ::map_for or
::map_for_aligned (as opposed to ::post_for or ::post_for_aligned) can
unmap itself when cancelled or accepted.

- add highlight command to comdraw interpreter:

highlight(compview compviewgs) -- set the highlight graphic state for a graphic

- changed ComTerpModule::reset to reuse buffers without reallocating them.

- fixed equality comparisons in comterp against nil (which is
ComValue::UnknownType under the hood).  Now nil!=0 is true (1) and
nil==0 is false (0).

- added base class method to set an OverlayView's HighlightGraphic and
member variable _hilite_gs to hold it.

- fixed bug in OverlayScript::ReadOther.  Now the attribute built from
a keyword with no following value(followed by the closing paren) gets
a value of true (1).

- add a global variable capability to comterp.  Now you can:

	global(v1)=100

and the value v1 will be available in all other copies of the command
interpreter running at the time.  If a local variable of the same name
exists, you can access the global value by:

	symval(global(v1))

The "global" command returns a ComValue of SymbolType with a new
global flag set to true.  This flag is subsequently checked when doing
symbol lookup, and if true the values are taken from the global symbol
table (a static class variable of ComTerp).

- add a AttributeValue::clear() method to zero out all the bytes of
the double sized multi-value union _v.

- add "frame" command to comdraw (and flipbook) to return the current
composite graphic.

- make comdraw versions of the "at" and "size" commands that work on
composite graphic objects (i.e. the list of sub-graphics gets used as
the list).

- add a static method ComValue::minusoneval to return a ComValue set
to -1.

- ensure a ComValue is really of ObjectType before returning the value
of the ::object_compview() flag.

- test for global symbol flag before doing local symbol table lookup
in comterp.

- ensure the global symbol flag is zeroed when constructing a ComValue
from a postfix_token struct.

- remove bug in comdraw "center" command.

- fix bug in "mbr" and "points" commands of comdraw (same one that was
in "center").

- annotate (prefix) the result from a timeexpr command with "timeexpr
result: ".  Otherwise it is kind of hard to tell where these things
come from.

- modify min and max commands of comterp so that max(num nil) is always num,
and min(num nil) is always num as well.

- preserve the ComTerp associated with a ComterpHandler if there is a timer evaluated expression still running.

- define AttributeValue::boolean_val() to return true for any symbol
or string value if the symbol id is greater than or equal to zero.

- new "delete" command for comdraw.

- new :clear flag on the "select" command of comdraw.

- new :scrn flag on the "center" and "mbr" commands of comdraw (to
return screen relative coordinates as opposed to drawing coordinates).

- fix :str keyword of print command (shortcut for :string)

- add :sym and :symbol keyword to print command, for generating
symbols the same way :str and :string can generate strings.

- fix a few cases in the execute method of a derived Comfunc where a
reference is initialized to a ComValue on the interpreter stack
(ComValue&), and then used after the stack has been reset for this
command (ComFunc::reset_stack), which obliterates all the input
arguments.  Instead a local copy of the ComValue is initialized.

- add a comdraw "growgroup" command:

	newgroup=growgroup(groupview compview) -- add graphic to existing group graphic

This is implemented with a MacroCmd (macro command) that has two
members, an UngroupCmd to break down the initial group into its
constituent parts, and an (Ov)GroupCmd to build it back up to include
the new graphic.

- add comdraw "trimgroup" command, to reverse the effect of a "growgroup"
command:

	newgroup=trimgroup(groupview compview) -- remove graphic from existing group graphic

Underneath the hood this a macro command (MacroCmd) with an ungroup
command (UngroupCmd) followed by group command (OvGroupCmd) with the
specified graphic removed from the list.  This does not delete that
graphic, but that can be done with a "delete" command if so desired.

- fix bug in comdraw "select" command, so that changes to the current
selection are graphically represented in the viewer.

- add pause command to comdraw.  Can be embedded in the middle of a
script, and allows for arbitrary commands to be evaluated until a
simple C/R is entered.

- add a "logger" mode to comterp:

comterp logger 'portnum'

Listens for and accept connections on portnum, then simply forward
the incoming messages to stdout, while ack'ing back with newlines. For
debugging purposes, not really a use of the interpreter.

- revise comdraw documentation, to make it more obvious that the
"import" command requires a string for its pathname argument, and that
a string has to be embedded in double-quotes.

- upgrades to smoothly compile on RedHat 6.2

- add a :n argument to the eq command (the command that underlies the
"==" operator), so that it can be used for partial string comparison,
i.e.:

	eq("string1" "string2" :n 6) 

returns true.

- fix up the comdraw text command to work at other than 1x mag.

- fix two bugs in the Attribute tool dialog box.  Make things work
when there are no attributes defined (a problem that cropped up since
using STL vector template to store the contents of the dialog buffer).
And use a ComponentView to hold the pointer to a Component being
examined by the dialog box, so that if the Component gets deleted in
the drawing editor the Attribute tool dialog box won't be fooled into
thinking it still has a good Component pointer.

April 28th 2000 ivtools-0.8.2

- Add a new version of a dot (".") func to comdraw, one that accesses
the AttributeList of a graphical component. This allows for easy
set/get access to the attributes of graphics in a drawing editor.

- Change default behavior of comdraw select func to return list of
graphics in current selection.  Implement the :all feature as well.
This is a non-backward compatible change for anyone who has relied on
the undocumented way the select func has behaved up until now (which
was the same as :all behavior should have been).

- change comterp list output (what gets printed when a list is
returned on the stack) to use "," instead of "\n" and surround the
entire list with "{" and "}".  Now you can see the difference between
lists of length 1 and scalars.

- copy/move capability for text editor with interpreter from
FrameUnidraw to OverlayUnidraw, and make use of it in comdraw.

- add a flag to ComValue (use space from one of two type-specific
unions) to indicate the void* pointer stored in an ComValue of
ObjectType is really a ComponentView, not the class indicated by the
classid symbol associated with it.  This allows derived ComFunc's to
detect whether an object pointer is really a ComponentView indirection
to some Component object.

- fix bug in comterp telcat mode where a bad pathname segfaults.

- extend OverlayComp::FindValue to support the "up" flag.

- change all the derived ComFunc's that work with ComponentView's to
set the ComValue::_object_compview flag, and provide a symbol for the
classid that corresponds to the kind of component.  This needs to
become a virtual method on every component, which requires adding
CLASS_SYMID to all the *comp(s).h in the OverlayUnidraw library.

- create "attrname" command to return name of attribute name/value pair.

- create "attrlist" command to return the AttributeList of a component.

- fix the adjusting of relative pathnames for an OverlayFileComp when
the whole document is saved out to a different directory.

- finish migration to use of ComValue::object_compview method.

- add FrameScript::suppress_frame method to trim the output of "frame"
objects from a derived program, i.e. a map viewer.

- extend the use of a symbol-table based class id to all the
components in OverlayUnidraw, GraphUnidraw, and FrameUnidraw, so that
the command interpreter can print the class name of objects returned
on the stack.  Elide the "Ov" from certain class names,
i.e. "RasterComp" instead of "RasterOvComp".

- fix the equality operator (==) of comterp to return 0 when one
argument is of unknown type (unless both are of unknown type)

- finalize arrangement of symbol manipulating commands of comterp:

	symid	return symbol id given symbol
	symbol  return symbol given symbol id
	symval	lookup value associated with symbol
	symadd  return symbol without value lookup

because symbol lookup is automatic in the interpreter, you only have to use symval when passing a symbol argument by variable to a command that accepts symbols without lookup.  The command will take the name of the variable for input, not its contents, so wrapping it in symval() has the desired affect.

symadd() is how you get a symbol assigned to a variable.

- add test for non-existent input file to run() command.

- extend list() command to initialize new list with contents of old
list supplied as the first argument, i.e. with "l1=1,2,3;
l2=list(v),4" lists l1 and l2 are distinct, where as with
"l1=1,2,3; l2=l1,4" l1 and l2 are the same.

- add numframes() command to flipbook interpreter, and
FrameEditor::NumFrames method.  

- fix bug in comterp ! operator that made it not work for anything but boolean.

- show many frames at once in ivtools flipbook with a new "showframes"
command.  If four frames (plus background) existed in a flipbook
editor, this would show the first and third frame (and the the
background), when entered into the interpreter:

	showframes(1,4)

This required generalizing the "other" frame concept of FrameEditor to
be a list of other frames to see instead of a single frame.  To
preserve the "current frame" concept in the editor, the list of frames
given to "showframes" is searched for the max frame to make it the
current (and foremost) frame, then internally all other "other" frames
are stored as negative offsets from this frame.  It would be possible
to have a mode (a keyword flag) on "showframes" to interpret the input
list as offsets both positive and negative from the current flag
(i.e. :offsets).

- add ComTerp::lookup_symval(int symid), to give a non-in-place way of
looking up a variable's value.

- make the comterp nil command post-evaluated, so none of its
arguments are processed or pushed on the stack.

- fix a problem where inner-parenthesis (or extra outer parentheses)
on an expression wouldn't work when part of the body of a
post-evaluated command (i.e. for, cond, while, etc.).

Before this didn't work:  cond(1 (1+2)*3)

Or this:		  cond(1 (1))

This time the bug wasn't in the mechanism for post-evaluating the
byte-compiled script, as many similar bugs have been in the past.
This time the fix was to a parser tweak adopted not that long ago to
generate blank placeholders in the parser output (the postfix
expression) to preserve where free-standing parentheses existed in the
original expression.

- and now a better fix for the inner paren problems of the comterp
parser.  I finally came to understand the origin of the problem was
not the popping of matched stand-alone parens, but in the failure to
recognize when parenthesized expressions are different from
parenthesized arguments.  Consider "a(b (3))" v.s. "a(2 (3))" (try
this with "comtest parser" if you want.  You might think the command
"a" has two arguments in each case.  But in the first case it has only
one, and the "(3)" is interpreted as arguments for the command "b".  

March 9th 2000 ivtools-0.8.1

Interpreter Changes
    
        * Add the "." (dot) operator to comterp, to allow for compound
        variables (i.e. "a.b").  They can be used on the right-hand or
        left-hand side of an assignment operator, and used pretty much
        anywhere a symbol can be used.
    
        The first operand is either a symbol to assign an AttributeList
        to, or an expression that evaluates to an AttributeList.  The
        second operand is always a symbol.  They can be concatenated
        (i.e. "a.b.c").
    
        * create a list func that initializes an empty list object.
          
        * extended the print func to invoke the ostream ComValue "<<"
        operator if it only has one argument.
    
        * add new symval command to returns the symbol value instead of
       looking up the value of that symbol in the variable tables.
    
    
        * documented acos, asin, and atan as returning radians,
        and cos, sin, tan as taking radians.

	* created autoframe command in flipbook command
	interpreter, and synched it with the "Auto New Frame" checkbox
	on the Frame pulldown menu.  So now you can set/reset this
	feature from either the GUI or interpreter, and the GUI
	reflects the state.

	* settle on "dotname" for the command that returns the name of
	a name/value attribute pair.  This is because "." (dot) is the
	operator used to create attribute list objects in the comterp
	command interpreter.  Normally most attribute objects are
	automatically indirected to the attribute value when finally
	applied, but in this command overrides that and returns the
	symbol which is the attribute name.


	* enable the command interpreter in the text editor panel at
	the bottom of the flipbook user interface.

	* copy anything but the last line in the interpreter text
        buffer to the end of the buffer before executing -- like shell
        mode in emacs.

Library Changes

        -- Attribute -- 

	* migrate macro for declaring symbol-table based class ids to
	one place -- Attribute/_comutil.h.  Rename it CLASS_SYMID
	(from classid).

	* AttributeList::add_attr fix.

	* new twist to the classid stuff.  Now classid() gets defined
	as a virtual function along with static methods for
	class_name() and class_symid() when you add the CLASS_SYMID
	macro (<Attribute/_comutil.h>) to a class definition.  This
	was used for identifying derived ComFunc's, ComFunc's that
	have a func symbol id as well, but might vary with
	internationalization or other custom changes to the
	interpreter.  But the symbol id of the class name itself
	doesn't change.

	-- ComUtil -- 

	* modify lexical scanner to preserve token state between invocations.
	This fixes a problem with multi-line comments when comterp is
	in server (when comterp is receiving input strings one at a
	time from an external source).  However, this does not fix the
	problem with multi-line strings when comterp is in server
	mode, which will require a better solution for preserving more
	of the token state (i.e. the partial token buffer) between
	invocations.  This is also a necessary step in preserving
	parallel use of one lexical scanner by more than one comterp
	in the same program.

	-- ComTerp --

	* fix a problem in server-mode comterp.  Part of making
	server-mode work was figuring out how to return from the
	depths of the lexical scanner in the middle of an expression,
	when an expression continues across multiple-lines, but the
	capability to retrieve a new line (or string) is external to
	the parser/scanner.  To make this work I made up the
	convention that if the input function (the function pointer
	with an fgets signature passed to the parser/scanner C
	routines) returns a null string (a string that begins with
	'\000'), return out of the scanner and parser, yet assume
	there is more to come.  When that function
	(ComTerpServ::s_fgets) was going to return the null string, it
	still traversed the entire input buffer, which is huge by
	default.

	* compress some code by making use of the new
	ComValue::is_object(int classid) method to test both whether
	something has a generic void* pointer for its value, and
	whether it has a known matching classid (based on a id in a
	symbol table for that kind of object).

	* migrate ComValue::geta() to AttributeValue::geta().  This is
	the method that returns a void* to an ObjectType if the
	classid matches.  Work for every object but ComFunc's and
	AttributeValueList's, which have their own types (CommandType
	and ArrayType).

	-- IVGlyph --

	* new Dialog methods to support stay-up dialog boxes that
	don't block events being handled by the main application:

    void map_for(Window*);
    virtual void map_for_aligned(Window*, float xalign, float yalign);
    void map_at(Coord x, Coord y);
    virtual void map_at_aligned(
	Coord x, Coord y, float xalign, float yalign
    );
    void unmap();
    boolean mapped();

        These are an alternate to the pre-existing Dialog::post_* methods,
        which map the dialog box to the screen then enter their own event
        handling loop (the run() method), then unmap the dialog box when
        done.
    
        With this new approach you call one of the Dialog::map_* methods
        to bring up the dialog box, and control returns to the normal
        event-handling loop of the main application.  The action taken
        when a Close or OK button has to be different with this new
        approach.  Instead of setting a flag that causes the local run
        loop to terminate, you need to explicitly call Dialog::unmap.
    
        Dialog::unmapped is provided as a way to test if the dialog is
        currently displayed.  Repeated calls to Dialog::map_* are ok,
        because the first thing these methods do is check if already
        mapped, and if so they do nothing.
    
        * create a new ObsTextDialog that uses the new Dialog::map_*
        methods (IVGlyph/odialogs.[ch]).
    
        * store the symbol id for a given ComFunc in a new _funcid member
        variable.
    
        * create a ComTerp::eval_expr method that takes an array of fully
        code-converted ComValue's ready to be executed.
    
        * so that a ComFunc execute method can ask ComTerp to invoke a
        certain ComFunc on the subsequent symbol to be encountered after
        the ComFunc execute method returns (ComTerp::func_for_next_sym()).
    
        * modify the various func of symbolfunc.c to generate scalar or
        vector results depending on whether there is a single or multiple
        argument.  Affected are symbol, symid, and symvar.
    
        * add mechanism to ComTerp to pass values to the next expression
        (ComTerp::val_for_next_func) and invoke a func on the next symbol
        (ComTerp::func_for_next_sym).  This allows for the stringing
        together of stand-alone expressions interspersed by keywords that
        lack parenthization.
    
        * add ComValue constructor that takes a ComFunc* directly and
        makes something of CommandType.
    
        * derive ComGlyph's ComTextEditor and ComTE_View from
	IVGlyph's EivTextEditor and TE_View.  This adds an interactive
	command interpreter capability to the text editor object,
	where the user can enter expressions and see results computed.
	While a command history plus anything else goes to stdout, the
	results follow just the expression, so it is sometimes easier
	to keep track of the commands you're using.  All of stdout
	could be rerouted to the texteditor window in the future.
	vhclmaps vhclviewer is the first place in the source tree
	where this capability is exposed for now.  Check it out.

        -- OverlayUnidraw --
    
        * the GraphicLoc tool to use the new ObsTextDialog box.  Now the
        GraphicLoc dialog box can stay up between uses of the tool, and
        each new click refreshes the displayed text.

	-- FrameUnidraw --

	* generalize the "select" command of comdraw to work in the
	interpreter of flipbook and anything derived from flipbook, by
	using the OverlayEditor::GetFrame() virtual method, which
	hides the fact whether a multi-frame system is in place or
	not.

Miscellaneous and Config Changes

	* change the default behavior of make with no arguments to be
	the same as "make World" the first time it used.  So now
	ivtools can build out of the box with the ubiquitous
	"./configure;make"

	* add --enable-install-subdir argument to ./configure.  This
	allows a user to install in /usr/local/lib/ivtools and
	/usr/local/bin/ivtools if they want (/usr/local can be changed
	with --prefix).

	* change src/scripts/mkdirhier.sh to work with new versions of
	mkdir that no longer accept multiple arguments.

	* pare down the various config/site.def.$CPU files to the
	things actually used/required.  Take out all definitions
	now provided by the ./configure script.

	* patches submitted by Gregor Zych to compile ivtools-0.8 with
	frozen Debian Potato.  The first patch adds a function
	definition that is disabled by default.  Someone would need to
	change the #if clause to correctly test for the Debian 2.2
	release.  This was the only thing that didn't compile smoothly
	on RedHat 5.1.

	* give variable names to all the constructor arguments in
	Attribute/attrvalue.h and ComTerp/comvalue.h, to improve the
	PERCEPS extracted web page.

	* change signature of accept() used in utils/sockets.cc to use
	an unsigned instead of signed int* as the third argument.
	This seems to be more the recent standard.

- format bug in ComValue::ULongType ostream output.


January 18th 2000 ivtools-0.8

Drawing Editor Changes

	* add "center" and "mbr" commands to comdraw, to return the
	center and minimum-bounding rectangle of a graphic.

	* make select-all the default behavior of the comdraw "select"
	command.

	* add -stripped argument to comdraw, to remove menubar and
	toolbar.  Use a -geometry as well to specify size of canvas.
	Control resultant program via stdin or telnet using the
	builtin command interpreter.  

	* add Pull/Push By One Commands to the Structure menu in
	drawtool, also making them available to any OverlayUnidraw
	based program.

Interpreter Changes
 
	* add LISP-like symbol assignment semantics to comterp.  Now
	expressions that return a symbol can appear on the right hand
	or left hand side of an assigment operator.  See new command
	"symvar", and "symbol" has been renamed "symval".

	* add support for command aliases to comterp, to allow
	multiple symbols to point to a command without having them
	listed via help.

	* make posteval((1)) work, by improved handling of the token
	generated for the extra nested parens.  Problem still remain
	with the handling of some forms of nested parens in
	post-evaluated expressions, but this is a start at fixing
	them.  This is the last outstanding known bug in the comterp
	language, though many features remain to be added.

	* fix problem with nested parens in post-evaluated
	expressions.  Now commands like these work:

	posteval((1+2)*3)

	cond((1+2)*3 1 0)

	The problem originated when for some reason the underlying
	parser was modified to spew a Blank whenever it popped an
	empty paren pair from the parser stack.  Doing that made
	something, I don't recall what, and could be useful in the
	future for representing n-depth streams by nested parens
	(i.e. ((1,2,3),(3,4,5),(5,6,7)) could be a 3x3 pixmap (or a
	list of 3 rgb values).

Config and Misc. Changes

	* add NetBSD support.

	* finalize links from embedded html (extractable by PERCEPS)
	to pre-existing man pages.  Now every man page can be reached
	by its corresponding classes html documentation.

	* test and revise the src/html/README that describes how to
	gen a set of ivtools html documentation.
