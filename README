			README for ivtools 0.9


This directory contains a release of ivtools 0.9.2.  You should read
the rest of this file for information on what ivtools is and the
INSTALL file for instructions on how to build it.

The overall copyright and permission notice for ivtools can be found
in the COPYRIGHT file in this directory.  It is similar to the X11
copyright, otherwise known as non-copylefted freeware.  

* What is ivtools?:

ivtools is a layered collection of application frameworks for building
custom drawing editors and spatial data servers.  It incorporates a
backward compatible copy of the original InterViews and Unidraw class
libraries and sample programs (from 3.2a.tar.Z), augmented with new
class libraries and sample programs for a wide variety of generic
spatial data applications.

ivtools comprises four sets of interrelated capabilities useful to
application programmers.  The first set is the libraries and example
programs borrowed whole from InterViews 3.1.  The second set is for
reusing and extending the light-weight glyph objects of InterViews 3.1
which embody a lot of the capability of TeX.  The third set reuses and
extends the Unidraw library (Unidraw is a major portion of the overall
InterViews 3.1 release that provides an application framework for
custom drawing editors).  The fourth set adds a command interpreter
and server mechanism to ivtools, and demonstrates these capabilities
with text, glyph, and graphic front-ends.  To get more of an overview
of these layers you can read:

    http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/ivtools-layers.html.

These are the libraries and example programs borrowed straight from
InterViews 3.1:

	IV		library of InterView 3.1, InterViews 2.6, Dispatch,
			OS, and TIFF objects
	dclock		digital clock with fading digits
	iclass		C++ class browser
	idemo		glyph demo 

These are the libraries and example programs that make up the glyph
part of ivtools (programs in the glyphs directory):

	IVGlyph		library of Glyph derived classes

	bdvtable        bounded-value editing 
	formdemo	value-editing 
	gclock		glyph-based clock
	meter           sliding meter
	radiogroup      radio-buttons
	scrollable	2d scrollable glyph
	scrollfield	2d scrollable field-editor
	strchooser	string chooser 
	text-editor     emacs-like text editor 
	timestamp	editable time glyph

Also all the glyph example programs from InterViews 3.1 have been
added in an examples3.1 directory under the glyphs directory.

These are the libraries and example programs that make up the Unidraw
part of ivtools:

	Unidraw		copy of Unidraw library from InterViews 3.1
	UniIdraw        librarification of 3.1 idraw 
	OverlayUnidraw  extended Unidraw/idraw framework
	TopoFace	spatial network library (nodes, edges, faces)
	GraphUnidraw    graph browser/editor library
	FrameUnidraw    multi-frame display mechanism

	idraw		idraw built on UniIdraw library
	drawtool        extended version of idraw built on OverlayUnidraw
	graphdraw       graph browser/editor integrated with drawtool
	flipbook        flipbook multi-frame editor based on drawtool

These are the libraries that make up the command interpreter part of
ivtools:

	ComUtil		command interpreter utility functions
	Attribute	attribute property list mechanism
	AttrGlyph	glyphs for Attribute library
	ComTerp		command interpreter objects
	ComGlyph	glyphs for ComTerp library	
	ComUnidraw      drawing editor with command interpreter
	DrawServ        drawing server framework with support
			for graphs and frames.

	comtest		test program
	comterp 	sample command interpreter 
	glyphterp	command interpreter user interface
	comdraw		drawtool with command interpreter
	drawserv        comdraw with both graphs and frames.

Note: GraphUnidraw/graphdraw and FrameUnidraw/flipbook have been
rearranged within the ivtools source tree to take advantage of the
ComUnidraw framework layer, so they really could be listed in both of
the previous sections.

There is also a Time library with Date and Time classes borrowed from
the NIH's class library, and an example program, ivxt, that shows how
an Xt widget can be wrapped around an InterViews application.
Finally, there is a collection of utilities (utils) and shell scripts
(scripts) that augment the drawing editors of ivtools with minor
capabilities.  See the relevant directories and files for further
information.
	
A series of makefile targets support the checkin of sources to
cvs/rcs, and their subsequent update and modification.  This requires
a copy of cvs available from the Free Software Foundation and
ivmkcm-0.7.2 available through http://www.ivtools.org/ivmkcm/

* More ivtools details

ivtools is known to build with many versions of gcc (<= gcc-2.7.2, >=
gcc-2.8.1, >= egcs-1.0.1) and on a variety of Unix'es: SunOS 4.1
(MIT's X11R5), Solaris 2.6 (X11R6), Irix 5.2 (SGI's X11R5), Linux 1.2
(Slackware 3.0, XFree86 3.1), Linux 2.* (RedHat 4.0 thru 6.0, Debian
2.*), NetBSD, and perhaps now FreeBSD.  There are contributed configs
that are out of date for HPUX and Dec Alpha. Recently it has been
built on Windows NT 4.0 using Cygwin from Cygnus Solutions (see
README.cygwin).  You can pick up Linux-ELF binaries from the ivtools
web page (http://www.ivtools.org).

If you have a question about this software, desire to add code, found
a bug, want to request a feature, or wonder how to get further
assistance, please send e-mail to the general purpose ivtools mailing
list, ivtools-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net, or this e-mail address:

* Finding and Generating Inline Documentation

Extensive documentation is embedded within the ivtools source tree,
including most all of the documentation originally available for
InterViews 3.1 and Unidraw.  Here is a list:

	- README/man pages for executable programs

	Within most directories that contain an executable program
	(a main.c) you'll find a README that explains something
	about the program, how to use it, what it does, what
	arguments it takes.  In the case of the drawing editors
	and command interpreters this README has been further
	processed into a man page, which can be found in its
	uninstalled state in the src/man/man1 directory or wherever 
	you elect to install them.

	- HTML class documentation

	Many of the C++ class libraries of ivtools are documented 
	using comments in the header files (the .h files) that can
	be extracted using PERCEPS, a Perl documentation generator for
	C++ (http://starship.python.net/crew/tbryan/PERCEPS/).

	See src/html/README for instructions on auto-generating these
	web pages yourself, or see the result on-line at:

		http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/classes/

	- InterViews 3.1 and Unidraw man pages

	All the original man pages from InterViews 3.1 and Unidraw have
	been preserved, and can be found in src/man/man3, or where ever
	you elect to install them.  They also can be browsed online at:

		http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/man3.1/

	- InterViews 3.1 reference manual 

	The original reference manual for InterViews 3.1 can be found in
	PostScript form at src/man/refman3.1/refman.PS.  It is also
	found in page-indexable online form at:

		http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/refman3.1/


* Building on top of ivtools

Copied from the ivtools FAQ: 

	http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/faq.html#standalonedevel

Q: How do I set up a stand-alone program or source tree on top of ivtools
for development purposes?

A: If you are writing a stand-alone program that will exist in a
single directory, simply copy an appropriate Imakefile and main.c from
a InterViews or ivtools example program directory, modify accordingly,
then use "ivmkmf -a" to generate the Makefile. Make sure you are using
a fresh ivmkmf that corresponds to your installation of ivtools. An
example of this is the comtop sample program, a stand-alone program
separate from ivtools that builds on top of the comterp command
interpreter mechanism.  

** comtop.tgz is now part of the ivtools distribution **

If you are setting up an entire source tree with both class libraries
and executable programs, you will want to get started by replicating
an equivalent source tree (i.e. vhclmaps) and change or rename all
directories or files as appropriate. 

** read more on vhclmaps at http://www.ivtools.org/vhclmaps/ **

The graylevel raster and painting mechanisms of OverlayUnidraw were
originated by Richard B. Kissh under contract to Vectaport Inc, as
well as the shared memory rasters and asychronous incremental download
of rasters.

The ComUtil library was originally developed at Triple Vision
Inc. under NSF Grant ISI-8521259 (authors/contributors: Robert
C. Fitch, Richard A. Fundakowski, Robert K. Graber, Scott
E. Johnston).

The ivdl URL downloading utility was developed by Eric F. Kahler under
contract to Vectaport Inc.

Keung Chi Ng of IET Inc. has provided a good deal of feedback on
ivtools over the years, and has assisted in demonstrating the
viability of the application frameworks by developing a variety of
vertical applications on top of OverlayUnidraw, FrameUnidraw, and
GraphUnidraw.

The balance of ivtools has been developed by Vectaport Inc. (P.O. Box
7141, Redwood City, CA 94063), with additional support from IET Inc.
(P.O.  Box 112450, Campbell, CA 95011) in the form of ARPA
subcontracts (DACA76-93-C-0025 and DACA76-97-C-0005), as well as
directly employing Scott Johnston from April 1999 thru August 2000 and
giving him the freedom to evolve ivtools and related open-source
frameworks as part of his job. There was also support from Applied
Sciences Inc, San Francisco, CA, in the form of a subcontract for a
Phase II SBIR from NASA Ames.
