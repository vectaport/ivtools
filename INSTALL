And if that doesn't work...

Instructions for building ivtools-1.2.1 from source, the long version:

0. Compilation Environment

Things you will need (or might want) before building ivtools:

0.a. a Unix machine (for Windows see README.cygwin).  We know it has
been built on Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, Irix, Dec Alpha, HPUX,
and SunOS.  It also builds on Mac OS X (Darwin) which is a
BSD-derivative OS.  As of version 1.0.7 ivtools is Jaguar ready.

0.b GNU make.  Test to make sure this is the version you are using
with "make -v"

0.c. The gcc compiler.  Recently we've been building and testing with
gcc-2.95.*, gcc-2.96, gcc-3.0.*, gcc-3.1, gcc-3.2, and gcc-3.3.
egcs-1.0.3 would probably still work, as would gcc-2.8.1 and
gcc-2.7.2.  You will also need an equivalent copy of libstdc++.
libstdc++ comes bundled with gcc-3.0 and greater.  Before that the
libstdc++ version numbers stay roughly in synch with the gcc version
numbers.  If you have gcc-2.8.1 you'd want libstdc++-2.8.1, etc..

** NOTE ** Now you can use gcc-2.96.  Ignore
http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/faq.html#gcc-2.96-problem

Be aware that sometimes the include files for libstdc++ are in
/usr/local/include/g++-2, a place that cannot be auto-determined by
the configure script.  Establishing a symbolic link to
/usr/local/include/g++ will fix the problem.

0.d. An installed copy of X11R6 as distributed by the Open Group, or
an equivalent (XFree86 for Linux/BSD/MacOS-X, or X11R5 from MIT).  If you use a
vendor's X11 product, the product should be based on X11R4 or later
and the product should include imake and the config files.

If you can't find imake on your system, you can get the sources for
imake from the X11R5 or X11R6 distribution at several public ftp
archives (such as ftp.x.org).

** warning -- imake used in combination with a non-GNU C preprocessor
** can be troublesome (i.e. the default one delivered with Solaris or
** DEC Alpha).  You'll want to rig your PATH environment variable to
** find the gcc variant of cpp.  Read more about it at
** http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/faq.html#imakecppprob

0.e. If you want to use the polygon intersection tools, acquire and
build clippoly, a LGPLed library for polygon clipping from:

http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/People/klamer/clippoly_entry.html

Add -fPIC to the CCFLAGS in the Makefile, then do a make, then build a
shared library in the clippoly directory with: "gcc -shared -o
libclippoly.so *.o" (you can leave out test.o if you want).

0.f. If you want to use the network server capabilities of the
ivtools programs, acquire and build ACE, a C++ middleware toolkit
available from:

http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE.html

We are currently using ACE-5.1 (or the latest copy of ACE) built
without threads support.  Follow these steps to build it from source,
or use the Debian binary if you happen to be working on that platform
(libace5.1-dev):

	tar xvfz ACE-5.1.tar.gz
	cd ACE_wrappers
	export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`       # csh: setenv ACE_ROOT `pwd`
	cd ace
	cp config-linux.h config.h  # substitute appropriate OS name
	cd ../include/makeinclude
	cp platform_linux.GNU platform_macros.GNU  # substitute OS	
	emacs platform_macros.GNU   # add "threads = 0" near top of file
	cd ../../ace
	make

Then use "--with-ace=$ACE_ROOT" when running the configure script as
described below.  

0.g if you want to build the ivxt example program, which demonstrates
the embedding of a ivtools drawing editor inside Motif widgets, you'll
need some version of lesstif or Motif (libXm).  To enable the ivxt
build, change line 7 of src/Imakefile from "#if 0" to "#if 1". Without
these libraries and include files the build of ivxt will fail, which
can be safely ignored.

0.h Finally, you might have an interest in building the IueServ
library and iueserv program, a networked command interpreter wrapped
around the class libraries of the Image Understanding Environment.
See http://www.aai.com/AAI/IUE/IUE.html for details on acquiring and
building this sizeable collection of public-domain and free software
class libraries for image understanding application development.

1. Configuring ivtools:

1.a. You no longer need to set your CPU environment variable to build
ivtools, but you still need a CPU specific configuration file.
Ready-made configurations that have been known to work exist for
LINUX, SUN4 (and Solaris), SGI, HP800 (HPUX), ALPHA, NETSBD, FREEBSD,
and CYGWIN (for Windows NT).  HPUX config file is known to be out of
quite out of date, the others will probably work with little or no
tweaks.

Use "make CPU" from the top directory to see the symbol ivtools will
use for your OS (grep config/arch.def for ArchitectureName to get a
complete list of possible OS'es).  Then look for a matching
config/site.def.<CPU> file, where <CPU> is the value returned by "make
CPU".  If it is there proceed to step 1.b.

Other variants of Unix can be attempted by creating the corresponding
config/site.def.<CPU>, i.e. site.def.AIX or site.def.MIPS.

Use SUN4 for Solaris as well as SunOS.  Although SUN5 would be more
correct, the config files automatically determine the difference
between the two OS'es by checking for SVR4'ness.

1.b Run the configure script in the top-level directory, by entering
"./configure" followed by any of the following arguments (--with
arguments are recognized as --enable as well):

  --with-ace=<path>                Path to ACE source
  --with-ace-libs=<path>           Path to ACE libraries
  --with-clippoly=<path>           Path to clippoly source
  --with-clippoly-libs=<path>      Path to clippoly libraries
  --with-iue=<path>                Path to IUE source
  --with-iue-libs=<path>           Path to IUE libraries

  --x-includes=DIR        X include files are in DIR
  --x-libraries=DIR       X library files are in DIR

  --enable-install-relative[=ARG]  install relative to source tree
  --enable-install-subdir[=ARG]    install in ivtools sub-directory
  --prefix=DIR			   to use when install-relative is false
				   (default is /usr/local)

  --enable-use-rpath[=ARG]        use -rpath when linking, to
				  embed shared-library pathnames
				  in executable. 

ARG can be 0 or 1, default is 1 when not specified.  The configure
script is usually able to automatically determine --x-includes and
--x-libraries (except on DEC Alpha). If the arguments for ACE,
clippoly, or IUE are not supplied, the configure script prints a
reminder, then proceeds to set up to build ivtools without these
libraries.

If you want to run the executables without installing them, use
--enable-use-rpath to embed the shared library pathnames into the
executables at link time.

Here is an example of using the configure script with ACE and clippoly
libraries:

./configure --with-clippoly=/proj/clippoly --with-ace=/proj/ACE_wrappers

Running the configure script generates two files, a config/config.mk
that gets included into each Makefile when used, and a
config/config-<os>-gcc.defs that gets used by "make Makefiles"
described below.  <os> is something like linux.  The last line of
output from the configure script shows this pathname.  Verify that
this is the same as the file included at the end of the
config/site.def.<CPU> file.  Change the site.def.<CPU> file if
necessary.

Also you may want to review the rest of the entries in the
site.def.<CPU> file to see if they are good defaults for your system.

** See http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/faq.html for more info.

2. Compiling ivtools:

2.a. cd to the ivtools-1.2/ directory (you'd already be in this
directory after running the configure script).

2.b. Compile it with a "make" command.  The first time it is run it
does all these individual steps (the equivalent of "make World"):

	- regenerates the top-level Makefile to snap it to 
	  the current directory ("make Makefile").

	- runs through the source tree and generates all 
	  the other Makefile's ("make Makefiles").

	- generates compilation dependencies for each 
	  directory with code to compile -- see the
	  Makefile.depend file in each <CPU> sub-directory
	  ("make depend").

	- compiles and links everything ("make -k").
	
If you have any trouble at this stage take a look at:

  http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/faq.html#SourceBuild

** Subsequent use of "make" will only do the "make -k" phase described
** above.  To redo everything, either do a "make World", or do a "make
** clean" followed by a "make".  The "make clean" deletes the files
** that suppress the make stateges, make.makefile, make.makefiles,
** make.depend, and make.make.

3. Testing:

Each directory under ivtools-1.2/src that begins in lower case (except
for "include" and "scripts") contains executables that exercise some
particular functionality.  "cd" to each particular directory, type
"<CPU>/a.out" and see what happens (the utils directory contains more
than one executable, things named other than a.out).  Quite a few
directories have README's that go into further detail on how to use
the programs.  ivtools-1.2/src/glyphs contains sub-directories of
glyph example programs.  ivtools-1.2/src/glyphs/examples3.1 contains
most of the simple example programs that were originally distributed
with InterViews 3.1.

There is also a src/tests directory, with one test program to date,
y2k/y2ktest.c.  This builds a small program that verifies the Date
object of the Time class library has no problem with Y2K or Y2.038K,
by allowing the user to enter "+" and "-" to increment/decrement the
year past these boundaries.

4. Installation:

"make install" is supported for all the libraries and a subset of the
more utilitarian example programs: the four original InterViews
programs (idraw, iclass, idemo, and dclock), the four idraw derived
programs (drawtool, netdraw, flipbook, and comdraw) and the two
comterp programs (comterp and glyphterp).  In addition the scripts in
src/scripts and utilities in src/utils get installed.  "make
uninstall" is supported as well.

When relative install is enabled (--enable-install-relative for the
configure script), the binaries are installed in
ivtools-1.2/bin/<CPU>, the libraries are installed in
ivtools-1.2/lib/<CPU>, and the run-time X resource and config files
are installed in ivtools-1.2/lib/ivtools.

When relative install is disabled (the default for the configure
script) the binaries are installed as stripped executables in `prefix`/bin
the libraries are installed in `prefix`/lib, and the run-time X resource and
config files are installed in `prefix`/lib/ivtools.

note: idemo, comterp, glyphterp, and comdraw have config files that
must be installed (either relative or non-relative) for the program to
find them at runtime.  drawtool relies on several scripts and
utilities for accessing graphics and image files that must be
installed as well for them to work.
